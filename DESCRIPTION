Title: Quality assessment for Miseq data derived from viral sequencing 
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Alicia Aranda Fernandez
Maintainer: Alicia Aranda <ali.afernandez99@gmail.com>
Description: This package provides a set of functions for NGS data processing, 
  quality analysis, filtering and demultiplexing. These functions are designed
  to be applied in consecutive order on Miseq raw data to obtain a set of 
  intersected haplotypes for each evaluated sample. With this consensus haplotypes 
  different kinds of computations can be made, i.e genotyping, variant calling and
  quasispecies diversity.
