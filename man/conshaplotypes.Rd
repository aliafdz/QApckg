\title{Generate consensus haplotypes}
\usage{
ConsHaplotypes(trimfiles, pm.res, thr = 0.2, min.seq.len = 150, max.difs = 250)
}
\arguments{
\item{trimfiles}{Vector including the paths of demultiplexed files by specific primer, with fna extension.}

\item{pm.res}{The list returned by \code{\link{demultiplexPrimer}}, including \code{fileTable}
and \code{poolTable} data frames.}

\item{thr}{Threshold to filter haplotypes at minimum abundance before multiple alignment.}

\item{min.seq.len}{Threshold to filter haplotypes at minimum length before intersection.}

\item{max.difs}{Maximum number of mismatches allowed in resulting consensus haplotypes with
respect to the dominant one.}
}
\value{
The function returns a \code{\link{data.frame}} object containing the intersection results
  for each combination of patient and amplicon region, including the initial number of reads, filtered out reads
  (for being below a given frequency threshold or unique to a single strand), overlapping frequency
  between both strands and the common reads (in percentage and nÂº of reads).

After execution, two FASTA files for each combination of sample and pool will be saved in a newly
  generated MACH folder; the first includes multiple alignment between forward and reverse strand haplotypes,
  and the second includes the forward and reverse strands intersected.
  Additionaly, some report files will be generated in the reports folder:
  \enumerate{
  \item{\code{MA.Intersects-SummRprt.txt}: Includes the sumary results by reads number after abundance filter and
    strand intersection.}
  \item{\code{MA.Intersects.plots.pdf}: Includes different barplots for each sample representing the frequency of
    forward, reverse and intersected strand haplotypes.}
  \item{\code{IntersectBarplots.pdf}: Includes different barplots for all combinations of patient and pool,
    representing the number of intersected and filtered out reads, the intersection yield and global yield.}}
}
\description{
Computes the intersection of forward and reverse strand haplotypes and generates some report files.
}
\details{
This function is designed to be used after the execution of \code{\link{demultiplexPrimer}} function
  from the same package. After the generation of FASTA files containing forward and reverse strand reads
  for the evaluated samples, \code{\link{ConsHaplotypes}} executes multiple alignment with \code{\link{muscle}} and
  returns the consensus haplotypes using \code{\link{IntersectStrandHpls}}, that will be saved using
  the helper function \code{\link{SaveHaplotypes}}.
}
\note{
A new file named \code{muscle.log} containing \code{\link{muscle}} options will be generated and saved in a folder named "tmp".
